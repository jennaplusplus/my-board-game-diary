My Board Game Diary
===================

Purpose
-------
This app was built as a way to record board game meetup attendance and gaming action. Users are able to create meetups with players and further assign these players to game events representing a single instance of a game being played.

Organization
------------
*Meetups* are the broadest level of structure in the app. They represent the general set of time at which games might have been played. Meetups have a name, a location, and a date. For example: "New Year's Party" at "Jenna's house" on "1-1-2015". Furthermore, you can add players to meetups to note in general who was in attendance.

*Events* represent a single instance of a game being played at a meetup, for example, a playing of **Pandemic**. If a game is played multiple times at the meetup, each of these will be different events. Players from the meetup can be assigned as players in a particular game event, and there is opportunity to fill out other fields like a game rating and a description of the outcome of the game.
